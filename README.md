# Youtubefy
Copy your favorite Spotify playlists to a common YouTube channel

---

# Why?
- Adblock is much easier to use on YouTube then Spotify
- I don't like ads (I assume you don't like them either)
- I can't afford Spotify premium (I live in a third-world country)

# How to use
- open the login page and authenticate using a magic link
- you'll need a Spotify playlist link (from the web app, desktop app or mobile app)
- enter the url (or just the playlist id) in the input and press the button
- wait for it to finish, you'll receive a youtube playlist link from the central channel
- enjoy! :)
